# Yash - TANDEMLOOP Programming Test

This repository contains solutions to the TANDEMLOOP first screening programming test.

## Programming Language Used

**Node.js (JavaScript)**

## Problem Descriptions and Solutions

### Problem-1: Calculator Class

Create a small calculator which performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using class.

- Calculator inputs: 'a', 'b' and 'type of operation'
- Datatype: 'a' = double, 'b' = double, 'type of operation' = string

### Problem-2: Odd Number Series

With a single integer as the input, generate odd numbers starting from 1 until count reaches the input value.

### Problem-3: Conditional Odd Number Series

With a single integer as the input, generate odd numbers based on specific conditions:

- For odd inputs: generate first n odd numbers
- For even inputs: generate first (n-1) odd numbers

### Problem-4: Multiple Count Dictionary

Get the total count of numbers listed in the dictionary which are multiples of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

## Files Structure

- `Problem-1.js` - Calculator class implementation
- `Problem-2.js` - Odd number series generator
- `Problem-3.js` - Conditional odd number series generator
- `Problem-4.js` - Multiple count calculator

## How to Run

1. Ensure Node.js is installed
2. Run each file individually: `node Problem-X.js`
3. Or use npm scripts:
   - `npm run problem1` - Run Calculator Class
   - `npm run problem2` - Run Odd Number Series
   - `npm run problem3` - Run Conditional Odd Series
   - `npm run problem4` - Run Multiple Count Dictionary
